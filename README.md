## Downloads

Download `ripme.jar` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ripmeapp2/ripme/releases). For information about running the `.jar` file, see
[the How To Run wiki](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/How-To-Run-RipMe).

The version number like `ripme-1.7.94-17-2167aa34-feature_auto_release.jar` contains a release number (`1.7.94`), given by
a person, the number of commits since this version (`17`). The commit SHA (`2167aa34`) uniquely references the
source code ripme was built from. If it is not built from the main branch, the branch name (`feature/auto-release`) is
given.

Note that this follows the Semantic Versioning spec (see https://semver.org/),
and uses the feature of the format that adds extra data after the `-` to
provide helpful context so that every commit on every branch has a dintinct
semver version associated with it.

## Installation

## List of Supported Sites

See the full list of [Supported Sites](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/Supported-Sites) in the wiki.

Note: Websites change over time and therefore rippers, which fundamentally depend on website layouts, can break at any time.
Feel free to open an issue if you notice something not working, but please search the list of issues to see if it's already been reported.

The list of supported rippers includes:

- imgur
- twitter (currently broken, needs to be updated for X)
- tumblr
- instagram
- flickr
- photobucket
- reddit
- redgifs
- motherless
- imagefap
- seenive
- 8muses
- deviantart (currently broken by major changes to the site)
- xhamster
- xvideos
- ... and [more](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/Supported-Sites)!

## Site Not Supported?

Request support for more sites by adding a comment to [this Github issue](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/issues/2068).

If you're a developer, you can add your own Ripper by following the wiki guide:
[How To Create A Ripper for HTML Websites](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/How-To-Create-A-Ripper-for-HTML-websites).

# Compiling & Building

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org). To build the .jar file,
navigate to the root project directory and run at least the test you
change, e.g. Xhamster. test execution can also excluded completely:

```bash
./gradlew clean build testAll --tests XhamsterRipperTest.testXhamster2Album
./gradlew clean build -x test --warning-mode all
```

The generated JAR (java archive) in build/libs will include all
dependencies.

# Running Tests

Tests can be tagged as beeing slow, or flaky. The gradle build reacts to
the following combinations of tags:

- default is to run all tests without tag.
- testAll runs all tests.
- testFlaky runs tests with tag "flaky".
- testSlow runs tests with tag "slow".
- tests can be run by test class, or single test. Use "testAll" so it does
  not matter if a test is tagged or not.
- tests can give the full stack of an assertion, exception, or error if you pass `--info` to the command

```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew testAll
./gradlew testFlaky
./gradlew testSlow
./gradlew testAll --tests XhamsterRipperTest
./gradlew testAll --tests XhamsterRipperTest.testXhamster2Album
./gradlew testAll --tests ChanRipperTest --info
```

Please note that some tests may fail as sites change and our rippers
become out of date. Start by building and testing a released version
of RipMe and then ensure that any changes you make do not cause more
tests to break.
