# Compiling & Building

The project uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).
To build the .jar file using Maven, navigate to the root project directory and run:

```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```

This will include all dependencies in the JAR.

# Running Tests

After building you can run tests by running the following:

```bash
mvn test
```

Please note that some tests may fail as sites change and our rippers become out of date.
Start by building and testing a released version of RipMe
and then ensure that any changes you make do not cause more tests to break.
