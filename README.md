If you're a developer, you can add your own Ripper by following the wiki guide:
[How To Create A Ripper for HTML Websites](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/How-To-Create-A-Ripper-for-HTML-websites).

# Compiling & Building

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) or [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).
Therefor both commands are given. To build the .jar file, navigate to the root
project directory and run:

```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
mvn -B package assembly:single -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```
```bash
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew clean build -x test --warning-mode all
```

This will include all dependencies in the JAR. One can skip executing the tests
as well.

# Running Tests

Tests can be marked as beeing slow, or flaky. Default is to run all but the flaky tests. Slow tests can be excluded to
run. slow and flaky tests can be run on its own. After building you can run tests, quoting might be necessary depending
on your shell:

```bash
mvn test
mvn test -DexcludedGroups= -Dgroups=flaky,slow
mvn test '-Dgroups=!slow'
```

```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew test -DexcludeTags= -DincludeTags=flaky,slow
./gradlew test '-DincludeTags=!slow'
```

Please note that some tests may fail as sites change and our rippers become out of date.
Start by building and testing a released version of RipMe
and then ensure that any changes you make do not cause more tests to break.
